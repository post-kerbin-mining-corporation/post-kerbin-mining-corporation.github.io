Welcome to the Post-Kerbin-Mining Corporation mod suite, which presents the set of mods that I develop for Kerbal Space Program. These include the Near Future Technologies series of mods and their companions like Station Parts Expansion and Cryo Engines. 

I've divided these roughly into the [Core Mods](https://post-kerbin-mining-corporation.github.io/mods), which provide the features players are typically looking for, and [Framework Mods](https://post-kerbin-mining-corporation.github.io/frameworks), which support and enable the cool stuff contained in the Core Mods. 

The pages on this site provide centralized links to repositories, screenshots, releases and download locations.

### Downloading and Updating

All mods in the suite are available on Spacedock, CurseForge and GitHub. They can be manually downloaded from these locations. All mods are also available for installation using the [CKAN KSP mod client](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90246-the-comprehensive-kerbal-archive-network-ckan-package-manager-v1180-19-june-2016/) for player convenience. 

To stay up to date, all mods are also compatible with KSP Addon Version Checker (AVC) which provides a notification ingame when a new mod version has been uploaded. Updates will also be avilable through CKAN. 

### Community

To discuss the mods, or if you are having issues, the first point of contact should be the **Forum Page** linked in each mod's description on this site. A Discord server is also available. 


If you wish to report a bug, please do so by raising an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository.
